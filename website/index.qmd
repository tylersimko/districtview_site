## Coming soon: A data science toolkit to study US school boards

<img class="logo-img" src="dv_logo.png" alt="DistrictView logo">

DistrictView is the <u>largest</u> collection of school board meetings ever assembled and publicly released. We identify, process, clean, and publicly release data on school board meetings as posted on YouTube.

DistrictView is a project co-led by two researchers working alongside a dedicated and brilliant team of data scientists, project managers, and others; more about them [here](researchteam.qmd)!
