<img class="logo-img" src="dv_logo.png" alt="DistrictView logo">

DistrictView is the <u>largest</u> collection of school board meetings ever assembled and publicly released. We identify, process, clean, and publicly release data on school board meetings as posted on YouTube.

DistrictView is a project by [Tyler Simko](https://www.tylersimko.com), Postdoctoral Fellow at Princeton University, and [Rebecca Johnson](https://www.rebeccajohnson.io/), Assistant Professor at Georgetown's McCourt School of Public Policy.

DistrictView is a companion project to [LocalView](https://localview.net/), by [Soubhik Barari](https://soubhikbarari.com/) and [Tyler Simko](https://www.tylersimko.com).
